Accessible, extensible, plain JavaScript autocomplete with multi-select.

I've used a lot of autocomplete plugins, but the combination of **accessibility**, **performance**, and **functionality** that I needed wasn't out there. So I've written this from the ground up for that purpose, building on the [brilliant accessibility of GOV.UK's accessible-autocomplete](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/15/what-we-learned-from-getting-our-autocomplete-tested-for-accessibility/) - with more functionality, a smaller file size, and (in my testing) better performance.

[Try out the examples](https://mynamesleon.github.io/aria-autocomplete/)

Key design goals and features are:

-   **multiple selection**
-   **extensible source options**: Array of Strings, Array of Objects, a Function, or an endpoint String
-   **progressive enhancement**: Automatic source building through specifying a `<select>` as the element, or an element with child checkboxes.
-   **accessibility**: Use of ARIA attributes, custom screen reader announcements, and testing with assistive technologies
-   **compatibility**: Broad browser and device support (IE9+)
-   **starting values**: Automatic selection based on starting values, including for checkboxes, `select` options, and for async handling.

## Installation / usage

### NPM and a module system

First install it

```
npm install aria-autocomplete
```

Then import it, and call it on an element (ideally a text `<input />`, but not necessarily...) with a source for your autocomplete options.

```javascript
import AriaAutocomplete from 'aria-autocomplete';

AriaAutocomplete(document.getElementById('some-element'), {
    source: ArrayOrStringOrFunction,
});
```

At its core, the autocomplete requires only an element and a `source`. When the element is an input, its value will be set using the user's selection(s). If a `source` option isn't provided (is falsy, or an empty Array), and the element is either a `<select>`, or has child checkboxes, those will be used to build up the `source`.

```javascript
AriaAutocomplete(document.getElementById('some-input'), {
    source: ['Afghanistan', 'Albania', 'Algeria', ...more],
});

const select = document.getElementById('some-select');
AriaAutocomplete(select);

const div = document.getElementById('some-div-with-child-checkboxes');
AriaAutocomplete(div);
```

### Plain JavaScript module

You can grab the minified JS from the `dist` directory, or straight from unpkg:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aria-autocomplete" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

### Styling Aria Autocomplete

**I would encourage you to style it yourself** to match your own site or application's design. An example stylesheet is included in the `dist` directory however which you can copy into your project and import into the browser.

## Performance

I wrote this from the ground up largely because I needed an autocomplete with better performance than others I'd tried. I've optimised the JavaScript where I can, but in some browsers the list _rendering_ will still be a hit to performance. In my testing, modern browsers can render huge lists (1000+ items) just fine (on my laptop, averaging 40ms in Chrome, and under 20ms in Firefox).

As we all know however, Internet Explorer _sucks_. If you need to support Internet Explorer, I suggest using a sensible combination for the `delay`, `maxResults`, and possibly `minLength` options, to prevent the browser from freezing as your users type, and to reduce the rendering impact. Testing on my laptop, the list rendering in IE11 would take on average: 55ms for 250 items, 300ms for 650 items, and over 600ms for 1000 items.

## Options

The full list of options, and their defaults:

```typescript
{
    /**
     * Give the autocomplete a name to be included in form submissions
     * (Instead of using this option, I would advise initialising the autocomplete on
     * an existing input that will be submitted, to also use any existing validation;
     * this approach is also compatible with the control in multiple mode)

Calling `AriaAutocomplete(element, options);` returns the API object, which can also be accessed on the element via `element.ariaAutocomplete`.
